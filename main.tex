%% WHAT is PDF/A
%%
%% PDF/A is the ISO-standardized version of the pdf. The standard's goal is to
%% ensure that he file is reproducable even after a long time. PDF/A differs
%% from pdf in that it allows only those pdf features that support long-term
%% archiving of a file. For example, PDF/A requires that all used fonts are
%% embedded in the file, whereas a normal pdf can contain only a link to the
%% fonts in the system of the reader of the file. PDF/A also requires, among
%% other things, data on colour definition and the encryption used.
%% Currently three PDF/A standards exist:
%% PDF/A-1: based on PDF 1.4, standard ISO19005-1, published in 2005.
%%          Includes all the requirements essential for long-term archiving.
%% PDF/A-2: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-2, published in 2011.
%%          In addition to the above, it supports embedding of OpenType fonts,
%%          transparency in the colour definition and digital signatures.
%% PDF/A-3: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-3, published in 2012.
%%          Differs from the above only in that it allows embedding of files in
%%          any format (e.g., xml, csv, cad, spreadsheet or wordprocessing
%%          formats) into the pdf file.
%% PDF/A-1 files are not necessarily PDF/A-2 -compatible and PDF/A-2 are not
%% necessarily PDF/A-1 -compatible.
%% All of the above PDF/A standards have two levels:
%% b: (basic) requires that the visual appearance of the document is reliably
%%    reproduceable.
%% a (accessible) in addition to the b-level requirements, specifies how
%%   accessible the pdf file is to assistive software, say, for the physically
%%   impaired.
%% For more details on PDF/A, see, e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A
%%
%%
%% WHICH PDF/A standard should my thesis conform to?
%%
%% Primarily to the PDF/A-1b standard. All the figures and graphs typically
%% use in thesis work do not require transparency features, a basic '2-D'
%% visualisation suffices. The font to be used are specified in this template
%% and they should not be changed. However, if you have figures where
%% transparency characteristics matter, use the PDF/A-2b standard. Do not use
%% the PDF/A-3b standard for your thesis.
%%
%%
%% WHAT graphics format can I use to produce my PDF/A compliant file?
%%
%% When using pdflatex to compile your work, use jpg, png or pdf files. You may
%% have PDF/A compliance problems with figures in pdf format. Do not use PDF/A
%% compliant graphics files.
%% If you decide to use latex to compile your work, the only acceptable file
%% format for your figure is eps. DO NOT use the ps format for your figures.

%% USE one of these:
%% * the first when using pdflatex, which directly typesets your document in the
%%   chosen pdf/a format and you want to publish your thesis online,

%% * the second when you want to print your thesis to bind it, or
%% * the third when producing a ps file and a pdf/a from it.

written into the pdf file's metadata. Write here the text that goes into the 
metadata. The metadata cannot contain special characters, linebreak or paragraph 
break characters, so these must not be used here. If your abstract does not contain 
special characters and it does not require paragraphs, you may take advantage of 
the abstracttext macro (see the comment below). Otherwise, the metadata abstract 
text must be identical to the text on the abstract page.

%% of the pdf file as well.
%% Syntax:
%% \copyrigthtext{metadata text}{text visible on the page}
%% 
%% In the macro below, the text written in the metadata must have a \noexpand
%% macro before the \copyright special character, and macros (\copyright and
%% \year here) must be separated by the \ character (space chacter) from the
%% text that follows. The macros in the argument of the \copyrighttext macro
%% automatically insert the year and the author's name. (Note! \ThesisAuthor is
%% an internal macro of the aaltothesis.cls class file).
%% Of course, the same text could have simply been written as
%% \copyrighttext{Copyright \noexpand\copyright\ 2018 Eddie Engineer}
%% {Copyright \copyright{} 2018 Eddie Engineer}
%%
\copyrighttext{Copyright \noexpand\copyright\ \number\year\ \ThesisAuthor}
{Copyright \copyright{} \number\year{} \ThesisAuthor}

%% You can prevent LaTeX from writing into the xmpdata file (it contains all the

\section{Introduction}

\thispagestyle{empty}
In the telecommunication industry, the network node functions have traditionally run on operator proprietary hardware which are dedicated for a specific purpose, commonly known as ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits). This has gradually led to long development and deployment cycles, higher cost of operation, etc., thereby hindering rapid technological advancement in the field. Slowly the network node functions are being replaced by virtualized software solutions that can run on generic computing hardware; thereby addressing the above problems and making the network more flexible. This network architecture where virtualized software solutions are chained or combined to form network node functions is called Network Function Virtualization (NFV).

In the NFV nomenclature, the software implementation of the network node functions or sub-functions are referred to as Virtual Network Functions (VNF). For instance, a network firewall, a DHCP server or a NAT function. The current de-facto VNF implementations run on virtual machines such as a Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM). But with the recent advent of containers and their gaining popularity due to some of their obvious advantages over virtual machines, there is a need to explore their suitability in NFV. Containers are comparatively light weight and utilize the same host kernel when compared to virtual machines. However, containers are still quite new in a NFV scenario and have quite some issues to be explored and addressed [][].
%% [ https://www.redhat.com/blog/verticalindustries/is-nfv-ready-for-containers/ ], there are several on going studies and  containerization in NFV is still in a nascent stage and  As listed in [ https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/94/slides/slides-94-nfvrg-11.pdf ], some of the key features needed in NFV environment are performance, portability/scalability and isolation. 

The scope of the thesis is to explore networking in containers, both in a standalone environment and also in an container orchestrated environment, utilizing DPDK for fast packet processing and SR-IOV for hardware vitalization, since they are of at most importance in NFV. Also, whenever possible, for a better understanding of the performance gain with DPDK/SR-IOV, a comparative study with and without them is done. In the thesis, for some of the basic tools, only the industry de-facto solutions are considered, such as  Docker for container run time and Kubernetes for container orchestration. Keeping these constant, the exploration is on the various networking solutions feasible for them.


The thesis also tries to improve the performance of multiple DPDK based applications running on a single host utilizing


%%While carrying out the experiments, scalability and generic nature of the solution have been given important consideration.


%%Some questions that need answering are : 
	%%- Hugepage isolation in containers, freeing of hugepage (on failure of DPDK application?) . It is important to consider multiple DPDK based apps running on the same host [2]
	%%- The same plug-in uses DPDK on VF on the host and just exposes it to container
	
%%Whenever any decision on technologies to be used is taken, it is done so with NFV consideration. Also, for container orchestration, Kubernetes is de-facto solution and is the only considered one in the thesis.

%%The next section covers the background in the field with explanations of the most used technologies  with some explanation on the evolution of some of them. The we go into the experimentation part with some implementation addressing gaps or upgrades on existing solutions making them more scalable or generic.

kirjoittamaan ryhtyess\"a\"an hyv\"a ajatella p\"arj\"a\"av\"ans\"a ilman liitteit\"a.
